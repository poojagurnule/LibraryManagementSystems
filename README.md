## Database Configuration
To connect to a MySQL database, update the application.properties file with the appropriate database URL, username, and password. The following properties need to be updated:
```
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<DatabaseName>
spring.datasource.username = <userName>
spring.datasource.password = <password>
spring.jpa.show-sql = true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=true

 ## Features

- Add new books with details.
- Update existing book information.
- Delete books from the library.
- List all available books.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Library Management System on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Apache Maven installed
- MySQL or H2 Database (configured in `application.properties`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
## There are Two models -
 * Book
 * Author
 
  
  ## Data Flow
1. The user sends a request to the application through the API endpoints.
2. The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
3. The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.
4. The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class
5. The controller method returns a response to the API.
6. The API sends the response back to the user.

## Usage
The Library Management System provides a simple RESTful API for managing books. You can use tools like Postman to interact with the API endpoints.

Endpoints
### Get all books:
GET (http://localhost:8080/book/all)

### Add a new book:
POST (http://localhost:8080/book/add)
* Request Body:

    "author": {
      
        "name": "ram"
    }
}
### Delete a book:
